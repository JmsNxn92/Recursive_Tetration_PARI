# Recursive_Tetration_PARI
A depository of code for constructing a tetration function using recursion; for Pari-Gp.
This code is intended as a pair to the paper The Limits Of A Family; On Asymptotic Solutions to The Tetration Function

Much of the documentation for this is self explanatory, and explained in the comments for the code.

We link to the arXiv paper which corresponds with this code. https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01990

See our repository Recursive_Tetration, which has similar code for Matlab. This is less desired though.
